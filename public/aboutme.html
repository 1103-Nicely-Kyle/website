  <div>I am a student at the University of Nevada, Reno majoring in electrical engineering. This website is meant to share some of the work I have been doing. This site is coded in html and css. It's hosted on firebase, and uses Pintrest to host the pictures. The contact page uses javascript with jquery, and formspree to send the form.</div>
