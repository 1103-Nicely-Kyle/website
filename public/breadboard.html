    <p><h4>Output 1 when 4 bit input is divisible by 3 using 8 to 1 multiplexer (IC 74151) and inverter (IC 7404)</h4></p>
    <p>The function of this circuit is to output a 1 (F) when the input (a, b, c, d) is divisible by 3. Input 
      a being the MSB and input d being the LSB. The logic is simplified by comparing the output F to the 
      least significant input bit d in sections of two inputs. This gives us 8 inputs in terms of d and d' 
      for the 8 data pins on the 74151 chip, and the inputs a, b, c become the data selection inputs S0, S1,
      S2, on the 74151. So essentially the data selection is selecting which data input goes to the output.
      And, the data inputs are just the simplified F = d, F = d', or F = 0 logic expression for each given
      a, b, c value it corresponds to. The 7404 inverter gives d'.

    <p><h4>Half adder (adds two one bit numbers) using 7486 and 7408</h4></p>
    <p>The Carry bit is only 1 when the two inputs are both on so they are going through an AND 
      while the Sum bit is only 1 when either a or b is 1 so a and b go throug an exclusive or (XOR).</p>
